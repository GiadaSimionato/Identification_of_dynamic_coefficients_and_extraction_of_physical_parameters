# Identification of dynamic coefficients and extraction of physical parameters.
## Estimation of internal wrenches using Newton-Euler algorithms: effect of the presence or not of physical constraints on parameters.

Project repository for the course of Robotics II, Sapienza University of Rome.

This repository contains the MATLAB code for the derivation of the dynamic models of a 3R spatial anthropomorphic and of the 7R KUKA LWR IV+ manipulators in order to identify their corresponding dynamic coefficients and to extract their sets of dynamic parameters. This work presents the result of the analysis of the internal wrenches according to feasible and unfeasible sets of parameters even in presence of friction phenomenon.

This work was completed on December 30th, 2019.
